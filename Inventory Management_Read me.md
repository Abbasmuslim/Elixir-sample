# Inventory Management
This is a module for inventory management. It provides functionality for creating, updating, and reporting on inventory items. It uses structs to represent inventory items, and has error handling for when there is insufficient quantity. Additionally, it has functionality for purchasing and restocking items, as well as reducing prices by a percentage.

This example shows a more complicated work that uses structs, error handling, and functional paradigm, it also uses Input/Output operations to interact with the user.
