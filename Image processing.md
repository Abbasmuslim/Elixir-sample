# Image processing
This is a module for image processing. It provides functionality for resizing, rotating, flipping, brightening and contrast adjustment of an image. It also has functionality for processing a single image and processing all the images in a folder. It uses the Image module to perform these operations and Path module to navigate through the file system. It uses pipeline operator (|>) to chain the image processing functions together.

This example shows a complex and lengthy work that uses the functional programming paradigm, chaining of function calls and file operations in Elixir.
